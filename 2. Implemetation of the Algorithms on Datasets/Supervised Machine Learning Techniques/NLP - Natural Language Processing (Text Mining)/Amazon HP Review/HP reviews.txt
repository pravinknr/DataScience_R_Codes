    I specifically bought this laptop for 1650 GTX, when I am playing Just Cause 3 it abruptly stopped and threw me this error (attached in pic) I restarted my laptop and still the same, as soon as the game starts its giving this error still not resolved, I first thought there might be an error with the specification, To my surprise the recommended specifications for Game are way to less than the laptop config.Worst service ever..... I am going to take a replacement. and check, if that doesn't work, will return the product.These are the specifications of the Game which I am playing(Just cause 3)Operating System: Vista SP2 / Windows 7.1 SP1 / Windows 8.1 (64-bit Operating System Required)CPU(Processor): Intel Core i7-3770, 3.4 GHz / AMD FX-8350, 4.0 GHzRAM(Memory): 8 GB RAMGPU(Graphics): NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 (3GB) / AMD R9 290 (4GB)Storage: 54 GB available space

    The laptop is powerful and fast but I bought this laptop because of Nvidia GTX 1650 4GB GPU. I am not able to run any game on this laptop, the game either freezes and crashes or I get the error DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED.I have tried upgrading/downgrading the graphic drivers, updating the BIOS, resetting the System, different games.Nothing seems to fix this.I want HP to help me with this so that I can write a positive review, I am stuck and feeling betrayed as this is a gaming laptop.

    The spec says it all. It's fast, powerful and it's bliss to work with. It is mesmarizing the way it handles the challenges I throw towards it. The thing which I personally feel that could be improved is the battery back up. Couple of more hours would have been better. I got 5 hours of back up with normal usage, if it would have been 7, that would be perfect and 16 gb ram too. Coz 40 Percent of RAM is already occupied on start up. So if you run anything like eclipse and multiple instances of chrome at the same time, the memory usage jumps to 60 - 65 percent.So I guess in the current world we live in, a laptop needs 16gb RAM, and 1TB SSD to cope up with our future requirements.But all in all, a great buy.P. S. It would have been even better with a wireless mouse and a laptop bag :P and a Ferrari if that's not too much to ask

    Before buying this laptop, I read all reviews. Lucky people got a good machine. Unlucky people got really bad ones. I got a VERY BAD ONE. I have never experienced such sorry performance from any laptop. I have owned a Thinkpad, a Samsung laptop, a Sony Vaio and the last was an Asus. Im really sorry to say that this 9th gen core i5 with 8GB DDR4 RAM is PATHETIC!1. Fan is running non stop2. It is so SLOW, you cannot do anything in it3. Have to click more than 2 or 3 times on any icon, window, etc.4. Start up takes 5 mins minimum5. I have tried Hitman Absolution, COD BO2, Far Cry 3 and 4, COD Ghosts. NOTHING works!! Nothing!!6. I am planning to buy Traktor full version. Thats y i bought this PC. But now I think it cannot run Traktor. With this kind of sorry performance.7. Connection to TV is a big headache. Sometimes display lag, other times no sound output from external speaker connected to TV. Various problems.8. WIFI is poor. USB connection takes ages!!9. I have stopped using. I have returned to my old Lenovo desktop with i3 and 2 GB RAM. Much faster10. Amazon has promised replacement, so I will wait.My advice to HP! Please dont sell such kinds of devices. HP is a renowned brand. This kind of un tested and below par performance will not be accepted. I will never again buy any HP product. Last but not least, if this laptop is not replaced with a WORKING one, I will donate it to an HP showroom and spread the good news in social media. So that people dont lose 58k on this piece of crap.

    Decent cpu and gpu. But falls short in screen. Not ips and colors look a bit dull. But overall good laptop. Csgo 220+fps, dota 2 100+. Thermals are good too.

    Pros:1.There is no flaws on windows booting with Solid state disk 512GB.2.Gaming optimization is well done.3.KeyBoard backlit keys and volume was perfect and audible.Cons:1.Storage is small while living in this generation.

    I bought two machines of HP in the month of July and July respectively. One started giving problems after a month and the second one started giving problems after 20 days. We have been calling their customer care for last 20 days but their technical support is simply horrible. I have wasted my 1,00,000 by keeping my faith in the brand HP. We have the recorded conversation with their technical support that i am going to put on social media.A big NO to their product. Please, guys, be aware of brand HP>

    Overall a good package deal in a decent price range .Performance is great due to gpu and 9th gen i5 and ssd. The display was average to me and not a problem while gaming ,the colors were good.Thermals were also good and it has a very good battery life.You can do any stuff with this beast whether gaming, coding,editing,etc.

    Good choice for the below 70k price range512gb ssd gets you a good start for gamingBoot time is Atmost 5 sec.Games run well, just need to optimize the Nvidia game experience accordinglyYou can control the heat but reducing from the optimal level in the game experience softwareBattery lasts for about 4-5 hours on normal usageThat is excel report's, YouTube, movies, songs etcCombinedThe charger is small unlike the behemoth brick charger we getWebcam is also okay, not much to talk about.Display though is sub par, not that bad butIt is not quite goodSound is also subpar, but you can adjustDefinately not a deal breakerThe design is sleek and it weighs around 2.3kgCan carry it with out much effort. McAfee antivirus is for 1month only, if it matters to you people.Warranty is 1year for the product, contact the service centre to extend it.Last but not the leastA good choice for midrange gamingPUBG was running on ultra with no problem, in case you want a benchmark reference with no stats.

    Overall a good package deal in a decent price range .Performance is great due to gpu and 9th gen i5 and ssd. The display was average to me and not a problem while gaming ,the colors were good.Thermals were also good and it has a very good battery life.You can do any stuff with this beast whether gaming, coding,editing,etc.

    Good choice for the below 70k price range512gb ssd gets you a good start for gamingBoot time is Atmost 5 sec.Games run well, just need to optimize the Nvidia game experience accordinglyYou can control the heat but reducing from the optimal level in the game experience softwareBattery lasts for about 4-5 hours on normal usageThat is excel report's, YouTube, movies, songs etcCombinedThe charger is small unlike the behemoth brick charger we getWebcam is also okay, not much to talk about.Display though is sub par, not that bad butIt is not quite goodSound is also subpar, but you can adjustDefinately not a deal breakerThe design is sleek and it weighs around 2.3kgCan carry it with out much effort. McAfee antivirus is for 1month only, if it matters to you people.Warranty is 1year for the product, contact the service centre to extend it.Last but not the leastA good choice for midrange gamingPUBG was running on ultra with no problem, in case you want a benchmark reference with no stats.

    I specifically bought this laptop for 1650 GTX, when I am playing Just Cause 3 it abruptly stopped and threw me this error (attached in pic) I restarted my laptop and still the same, as soon as the game starts its giving this error still not resolved, I first thought there might be an error with the specification, To my surprise the recommended specifications for Game are way to less than the laptop config.Worst service ever..... I am going to take a replacement. and check, if that doesn't work, will return the product.These are the specifications of the Game which I am playing(Just cause 3)Operating System: Vista SP2 / Windows 7.1 SP1 / Windows 8.1 (64-bit Operating System Required)CPU(Processor): Intel Core i7-3770, 3.4 GHz / AMD FX-8350, 4.0 GHzRAM(Memory): 8 GB RAMGPU(Graphics): NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 (3GB) / AMD R9 290 (4GB)Storage: 54 GB available space

    The laptop is powerful and fast but I bought this laptop because of Nvidia GTX 1650 4GB GPU. I am not able to run any game on this laptop, the game either freezes and crashes or I get the error DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED.I have tried upgrading/downgrading the graphic drivers, updating the BIOS, resetting the System, different games.Nothing seems to fix this.I want HP to help me with this so that I can write a positive review, I am stuck and feeling betrayed as this is a gaming laptop.

    The spec says it all. It's fast, powerful and it's bliss to work with. It is mesmarizing the way it handles the challenges I throw towards it. The thing which I personally feel that could be improved is the battery back up. Couple of more hours would have been better. I got 5 hours of back up with normal usage, if it would have been 7, that would be perfect and 16 gb ram too. Coz 40 Percent of RAM is already occupied on start up. So if you run anything like eclipse and multiple instances of chrome at the same time, the memory usage jumps to 60 - 65 percent.So I guess in the current world we live in, a laptop needs 16gb RAM, and 1TB SSD to cope up with our future requirements.But all in all, a great buy.P. S. It would have been even better with a wireless mouse and a laptop bag :P and a Ferrari if that's not too much to ask

    Before buying this laptop, I read all reviews. Lucky people got a good machine. Unlucky people got really bad ones. I got a VERY BAD ONE. I have never experienced such sorry performance from any laptop. I have owned a Thinkpad, a Samsung laptop, a Sony Vaio and the last was an Asus. Im really sorry to say that this 9th gen core i5 with 8GB DDR4 RAM is PATHETIC!1. Fan is running non stop2. It is so SLOW, you cannot do anything in it3. Have to click more than 2 or 3 times on any icon, window, etc.4. Start up takes 5 mins minimum5. I have tried Hitman Absolution, COD BO2, Far Cry 3 and 4, COD Ghosts. NOTHING works!! Nothing!!6. I am planning to buy Traktor full version. Thats y i bought this PC. But now I think it cannot run Traktor. With this kind of sorry performance.7. Connection to TV is a big headache. Sometimes display lag, other times no sound output from external speaker connected to TV. Various problems.8. WIFI is poor. USB connection takes ages!!9. I have stopped using. I have returned to my old Lenovo desktop with i3 and 2 GB RAM. Much faster10. Amazon has promised replacement, so I will wait.My advice to HP! Please dont sell such kinds of devices. HP is a renowned brand. This kind of un tested and below par performance will not be accepted. I will never again buy any HP product. Last but not least, if this laptop is not replaced with a WORKING one, I will donate it to an HP showroom and spread the good news in social media. So that people dont lose 58k on this piece of crap.

    Decent cpu and gpu. But falls short in screen. Not ips and colors look a bit dull. But overall good laptop. Csgo 220+fps, dota 2 100+. Thermals are good too.

    Pros:1.There is no flaws on windows booting with Solid state disk 512GB.2.Gaming optimization is well done.3.KeyBoard backlit keys and volume was perfect and audible.Cons:1.Storage is small while living in this generation.

    I bought two machines of HP in the month of July and July respectively. One started giving problems after a month and the second one started giving problems after 20 days. We have been calling their customer care for last 20 days but their technical support is simply horrible. I have wasted my 1,00,000 by keeping my faith in the brand HP. We have the recorded conversation with their technical support that i am going to put on social media.A big NO to their product. Please, guys, be aware of brand HP>

HP is a renowned brand. This kind of un tested and below par performance will not be accepted. I will never again buy any HP product. Last but not least, if this laptop is not replaced with a WORKING one, I will donate it to an HP showroom and spread the good news in social media. So that people dont lose 58k on this piece of crap.

    Decent cpu and gpu. But falls short in screen. Not ips and colors look a bit dull. But overall good laptop. Csgo 220+fps, dota 2 100+. Thermals are good too.

    Pros:1.There is no flaws on windows booting with Solid state disk 512GB.2.Gaming optimization is well done.3.KeyBoard backlit keys and volume was perfect and audible.Cons:1.Storage is small while living in this generation.

    I bought two machines of HP in the month of July and July respectively. One started giving problems after a month and the second one started giving problems after 20 days. We have been calling their customer care for last 20 days but their technical support is simply horrible. I have wasted my 1,00,000 by keeping my faith in the brand HP. We have the recorded conversation with their technical support that i am going to put on social media.A big NO to their product. Please, guys, be aware of brand HP>

    Overall a good package deal in a decent price range .Performance is great due to gpu and 9th gen i5 and ssd. The display was average to me and not a problem while gaming ,the colors were good.Thermals were also good and it has a very good battery life.You can do any stuff with this beast whether gaming, coding,editing,etc.

    Good choice for the below 70k price range512gb ssd gets you a good start for gamingBoot time is Atmost 5 sec.Games run well, just need to optimize the Nvidia game experience accordinglyYou can control the heat but reducing from the optimal level in the game experience softwareBattery lasts for about 4-5 hours on normal usageThat is excel report's, YouTube, movies, songs etcCombinedThe charger is small unlike the behemoth brick charger we getWebcam is also okay, not much to talk about.Display though is sub par, not that bad butIt is not quite goodSound is also subpar, but you can adjustDefinately not a deal breakerThe design is sleek and it weighs around 2.3kgCan carry it with out much effort. McAfee antivirus is for 1month only, if it matters to you people.Warranty is 1year for the product, contact the service centre to extend it.Last but not the leastA good choice for midrange gamingPUBG was running on ultra with no problem, in case you want a benchmark reference with no stats.

    I specifically bought this laptop for 1650 GTX, when I am playing Just Cause 3 it abruptly stopped and threw me this error (attached in pic) I restarted my laptop and still the same, as soon as the game starts its giving this error still not resolved, I first thought there might be an error with the specification, To my surprise the recommended specifications for Game are way to less than the laptop config.Worst service ever..... I am going to take a replacement. and check, if that doesn't work, will return the product.These are the specifications of the Game which I am playing(Just cause 3)Operating System: Vista SP2 / Windows 7.1 SP1 / Windows 8.1 (64-bit Operating System Required)CPU(Processor): Intel Core i7-3770, 3.4 GHz / AMD FX-8350, 4.0 GHzRAM(Memory): 8 GB RAMGPU(Graphics): NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 (3GB) / AMD R9 290 (4GB)Storage: 54 GB available space

    The laptop is powerful and fast but I bought this laptop because of Nvidia GTX 1650 4GB GPU. I am not able to run any game on this laptop, the game either freezes and crashes or I get the error DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED.I have tried upgrading/downgrading the graphic drivers, updating the BIOS, resetting the System, different games.Nothing seems to fix this.I want HP to help me with this so that I can write a positive review, I am stuck and feeling betrayed as this is a gaming laptop.

    The spec says it all. It's fast, powerful and it's bliss to work with. It is mesmarizing the way it handles the challenges I throw towards it. The thing which I personally feel that could be improved is the battery back up. Couple of more hours would have been better. I got 5 hours of back up with normal usage, if it would have been 7, that would be perfect and 16 gb ram too. Coz 40 Percent of RAM is already occupied on start up. So if you run anything like eclipse and multiple instances of chrome at the same time, the memory usage jumps to 60 - 65 percent.So I guess in the current world we live in, a laptop needs 16gb RAM, and 1TB SSD to cope up with our future requirements.But all in all, a great buy.P. S. It would have been even better with a wireless mouse and a laptop bag :P and a Ferrari if that's not too much to ask

    Before buying this laptop, I read all reviews. Lucky people got a good machine. Unlucky people got really bad ones. I got a VERY BAD ONE. I have never experienced such sorry performance from any laptop. I have owned a Thinkpad, a Samsung laptop, a Sony Vaio and the last was an Asus. Im really sorry to say that this 9th gen core i5 with 8GB DDR4 RAM is PATHETIC!1. Fan is running non stop2. It is so SLOW, you cannot do anything in it3. Have to click more than 2 or 3 times on any icon, window, etc.4. Start up takes 5 mins minimum5. I have tried Hitman Absolution, COD BO2, Far Cry 3 and 4, COD Ghosts. NOTHING works!! Nothing!!6. I am planning to buy Traktor full version. Thats y i bought this PC. But now I think it cannot run Traktor. With this kind of sorry performance.7. Connection to TV is a big headache. Sometimes display lag, other times no sound output from external speaker connected to TV. Various problems.8. WIFI is poor. USB connection takes ages!!9. I have stopped using. I have returned to my old Lenovo desktop with i3 and 2 GB RAM. Much faster10. Amazon has promised replacement, so I will wait.My advice to HP! Please dont sell such kinds of devices.

So if you run anything like eclipse and multiple instances of chrome at the same time, the memory usage jumps to 60 - 65 percent.So I guess in the current world we live in, a laptop needs 16gb RAM, and 1TB SSD to cope up with our future requirements.But all in all, a great buy.P. S. It would have been even better with a wireless mouse and a laptop bag :P and a Ferrari if that's not too much to ask

    Before buying this laptop, I read all reviews. Lucky people got a good machine. Unlucky people got really bad ones. I got a VERY BAD ONE. I have never experienced such sorry performance from any laptop. I have owned a Thinkpad, a Samsung laptop, a Sony Vaio and the last was an Asus. Im really sorry to say that this 9th gen core i5 with 8GB DDR4 RAM is PATHETIC!1. Fan is running non stop2. It is so SLOW, you cannot do anything in it3. Have to click more than 2 or 3 times on any icon, window, etc.4. Start up takes 5 mins minimum5. I have tried Hitman Absolution, COD BO2, Far Cry 3 and 4, COD Ghosts. NOTHING works!! Nothing!!6. I am planning to buy Traktor full version. Thats y i bought this PC. But now I think it cannot run Traktor. With this kind of sorry performance.7. Connection to TV is a big headache. Sometimes display lag, other times no sound output from external speaker connected to TV. Various problems.8. WIFI is poor. USB connection takes ages!!9. I have stopped using. I have returned to my old Lenovo desktop with i3 and 2 GB RAM. Much faster10. Amazon has promised replacement, so I will wait.My advice to HP! Please dont sell such kinds of devices. HP is a renowned brand. This kind of un tested and below par performance will not be accepted. I will never again buy any HP product. Last but not least, if this laptop is not replaced with a WORKING one, I will donate it to an HP showroom and spread the good news in social media. So that people dont lose 58k on this piece of crap.

    Decent cpu and gpu. But falls short in screen. Not ips and colors look a bit dull. But overall good laptop. Csgo 220+fps, dota 2 100+. Thermals are good too.

    Pros:1.There is no flaws on windows booting with Solid state disk 512GB.2.Gaming optimization is well done.3.KeyBoard backlit keys and volume was perfect and audible.Cons:1.Storage is small while living in this generation.

    I bought two machines of HP in the month of July and July respectively. One started giving problems after a month and the second one started giving problems after 20 days. We have been calling their customer care for last 20 days but their technical support is simply horrible. I have wasted my 1,00,000 by keeping my faith in the brand HP. We have the recorded conversation with their technical support that i am going to put on social media.A big NO to their product. Please, guys, be aware of brand HP>

    Overall a good package deal in a decent price range .Performance is great due to gpu and 9th gen i5 and ssd. The display was average to me and not a problem while gaming ,the colors were good.Thermals were also good and it has a very good battery life.You can do any stuff with this beast whether gaming, coding,editing,etc.

    Good choice for the below 70k price range512gb ssd gets you a good start for gamingBoot time is Atmost 5 sec.Games run well, just need to optimize the Nvidia game experience accordinglyYou can control the heat but reducing from the optimal level in the game experience softwareBattery lasts for about 4-5 hours on normal usageThat is excel report's, YouTube, movies, songs etcCombinedThe charger is small unlike the behemoth brick charger we getWebcam is also okay, not much to talk about.Display though is sub par, not that bad butIt is not quite goodSound is also subpar, but you can adjustDefinately not a deal breakerThe design is sleek and it weighs around 2.3kgCan carry it with out much effort. McAfee antivirus is for 1month only, if it matters to you people.Warranty is 1year for the product, contact the service centre to extend it.Last but not the leastA good choice for midrange gamingPUBG was running on ultra with no problem, in case you want a benchmark reference with no stats.

    I specifically bought this laptop for 1650 GTX, when I am playing Just Cause 3 it abruptly stopped and threw me this error (attached in pic) I restarted my laptop and still the same, as soon as the game starts its giving this error still not resolved, I first thought there might be an error with the specification, To my surprise the recommended specifications for Game are way to less than the laptop config.Worst service ever..... I am going to take a replacement. and check, if that doesn't work, will return the product.These are the specifications of the Game which I am playing(Just cause 3)Operating System: Vista SP2 / Windows 7.1 SP1 / Windows 8.1 (64-bit Operating System Required)CPU(Processor): Intel Core i7-3770, 3.4 GHz / AMD FX-8350, 4.0 GHzRAM(Memory): 8 GB RAMGPU(Graphics): NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 (3GB) / AMD R9 290 (4GB)Storage: 54 GB available space

    The laptop is powerful and fast but I bought this laptop because of Nvidia GTX 1650 4GB GPU. I am not able to run any game on this laptop, the game either freezes and crashes or I get the error DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED.I have tried upgrading/downgrading the graphic drivers, updating the BIOS, resetting the System, different games.Nothing seems to fix this.I want HP to help me with this so that I can write a positive review, I am stuck and feeling betrayed as this is a gaming laptop.

    The spec says it all. It's fast, powerful and it's bliss to work with. It is mesmarizing the way it handles the challenges I throw towards it.

    I specifically bought this laptop for 1650 GTX, when I am playing Just Cause 3 it abruptly stopped and threw me this error (attached in pic) I restarted my laptop and still the same, as soon as the game starts its giving this error still not resolved, I first thought there might be an error with the specification, To my surprise the recommended specifications for Game are way to less than the laptop config.Worst service ever..... I am going to take a replacement. and check, if that doesn't work, will return the product.These are the specifications of the Game which I am playing(Just cause 3)Operating System: Vista SP2 / Windows 7.1 SP1 / Windows 8.1 (64-bit Operating System Required)CPU(Processor): Intel Core i7-3770, 3.4 GHz / AMD FX-8350, 4.0 GHzRAM(Memory): 8 GB RAMGPU(Graphics): NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 (3GB) / AMD R9 290 (4GB)Storage: 54 GB available space

    The laptop is powerful and fast but I bought this laptop because of Nvidia GTX 1650 4GB GPU. I am not able to run any game on this laptop, the game either freezes and crashes or I get the error DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED.I have tried upgrading/downgrading the graphic drivers, updating the BIOS, resetting the System, different games.Nothing seems to fix this.I want HP to help me with this so that I can write a positive review, I am stuck and feeling betrayed as this is a gaming laptop.

    The spec says it all. It's fast, powerful and it's bliss to work with. It is mesmarizing the way it handles the challenges I throw towards it. The thing which I personally feel that could be improved is the battery back up. Couple of more hours would have been better. I got 5 hours of back up with normal usage, if it would have been 7, that would be perfect and 16 gb ram too. Coz 40 Percent of RAM is already occupied on start up. So if you run anything like eclipse and multiple instances of chrome at the same time, the memory usage jumps to 60 - 65 percent.So I guess in the current world we live in, a laptop needs 16gb RAM, and 1TB SSD to cope up with our future requirements.But all in all, a great buy.P. S. It would have been even better with a wireless mouse and a laptop bag :P and a Ferrari if that's not too much to ask

    Before buying this laptop, I read all reviews. Lucky people got a good machine. Unlucky people got really bad ones. I got a VERY BAD ONE. I have never experienced such sorry performance from any laptop. I have owned a Thinkpad, a Samsung laptop, a Sony Vaio and the last was an Asus. Im really sorry to say that this 9th gen core i5 with 8GB DDR4 RAM is PATHETIC!1. Fan is running non stop2. It is so SLOW, you cannot do anything in it3. Have to click more than 2 or 3 times on any icon, window, etc.4. Start up takes 5 mins minimum5. I have tried Hitman Absolution, COD BO2, Far Cry 3 and 4, COD Ghosts. NOTHING works!! Nothing!!6. I am planning to buy Traktor full version. Thats y i bought this PC. But now I think it cannot run Traktor. With this kind of sorry performance.7. Connection to TV is a big headache. Sometimes display lag, other times no sound output from external speaker connected to TV. Various problems.8. WIFI is poor. USB connection takes ages!!9. I have stopped using. I have returned to my old Lenovo desktop with i3 and 2 GB RAM. Much faster10. Amazon has promised replacement, so I will wait.My advice to HP! Please dont sell such kinds of devices. HP is a renowned brand. This kind of un tested and below par performance will not be accepted. I will never again buy any HP product. Last but not least, if this laptop is not replaced with a WORKING one, I will donate it to an HP showroom and spread the good news in social media. So that people dont lose 58k on this piece of crap.

    Decent cpu and gpu. But falls short in screen. Not ips and colors look a bit dull. But overall good laptop. Csgo 220+fps, dota 2 100+. Thermals are good too.

    Pros:1.There is no flaws on windows booting with Solid state disk 512GB.2.Gaming optimization is well done.3.KeyBoard backlit keys and volume was perfect and audible.Cons:1.Storage is small while living in this generation.

    I bought two machines of HP in the month of July and July respectively. One started giving problems after a month and the second one started giving problems after 20 days. We have been calling their customer care for last 20 days but their technical support is simply horrible. I have wasted my 1,00,000 by keeping my faith in the brand HP. We have the recorded conversation with their technical support that i am going to put on social media.A big NO to their product. Please, guys, be aware of brand HP>

    Overall a good package deal in a decent price range .Performance is great due to gpu and 9th gen i5 and ssd. The display was average to me and not a problem while gaming ,the colors were good.Thermals were also good and it has a very good battery life.You can do any stuff with this beast whether gaming, coding,editing,etc.

    Good choice for the below 70k price range512gb ssd gets you a good start for gamingBoot time is Atmost 5 sec.Games run well, just need to optimize the Nvidia game experience accordinglyYou can control the heat but reducing from the optimal level in the game experience softwareBattery lasts for about 4-5 hours on normal usageThat is excel report's, YouTube, movies, songs etcCombinedThe charger is small unlike the behemoth brick charger we getWebcam is also okay, not much to talk about.Display though is sub par, not that bad butIt is not quite goodSound is also subpar, but you can adjustDefinately not a deal breakerThe design is sleek and it weighs around 2.3kgCan carry it with out much effort. McAfee antivirus is for 1month only, if it matters to you people.Warranty is 1year for the product, contact the service centre to extend it.Last but not the leastA good choice for midrange gamingPUBG was running on ultra with no problem, in case you want a benchmark reference with no stats.
